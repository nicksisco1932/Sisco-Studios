# Fractured Memory: Evolution Toward the Horizon

This is the through-line I can see now. A scattered, evolving terrain of visual thought. None of the *Fractured Horizon* series is here‚Äîbut everything here leads to it. 

Each of these pieces taught me something about space, perception, or memory. Some punched through. Some whispered. But all of them moved the dial.

## üß† Early Thematic Foundations

### 1. Sunset over Hills *(Jan 25)*
![Sunset over Hills](path/to/sunset_over_hills.jpg)

The emotional weight here surprised me. I wasn't trying to go deep, but the saturated oranges and heavy blacks hit harder than expected. 

There's a simplicity to the silhouette and horizon line that still resonates with how I build compositions today‚Äîit's color as pressure, light as mood.

### 2. Radiating Cactus Sunset *(Feb 5)*
![Radiating Cactus Sunset](path/to/radiating_cactus_sunset.jpg)

This one is almost euphoric. The cactus feels like a stand-in for me‚Äîalone but radiant, watching something greater unfold. 

There's a Van Gogh energy here I didn‚Äôt see until later. It‚Äôs not about detail‚Äîit‚Äôs about force. This was an early sign I was moving toward cognitive landscapes.

---

### 3. Minimalist Blue & White Geometry *(July 9)*
![Minimalist Blue & White Geometry](path/to/blue_white_geometry.jpg)

A hard left turn. I ditched warmth, ditched representation, and leaned into cold angles and disorientation. 

It reads more like a mental space than a visual one. This might be the first *true* precursor to the *Fractured Horizon* approach.

## üé® Visual Techniques that Begin to Fragment Space

### 4. Brown Horizontal Abstract *(July 10)*
![Brown Horizontal Abstract](path/to/brown_horizontal.jpg)

This one flattens space in a weird way. Could be a desert, could be sediment, could be a plank of wood. That ambiguity‚Äîwhere the brain can‚Äôt lock in‚Äîwas new to me.

I didn‚Äôt know it yet, but this was me starting to break the rules of spatial consistency.

---

### 5. Pen Drawing *(Dec 19, 2020)*
![Pen Drawing](path/to/pen_drawing.jpg)

It‚Äôs raw and jagged, and it‚Äôs got tension. Mountains slicing into valleys, a sky that can‚Äôt sit still. 

This might be the first drawing where fractured space and restless energy collided. You could trace a straight line from here to *Fractured Horizon 3*.

---

### 6. Watercolor Mountain Scene *(Dec 20, 2020)*
![Watercolor Mountain Scene](path/to/watercolor_mountain.jpg)

It looks clean, even childlike, but the dual logic in the peaks already pulls apart. 

Two halves that shouldn‚Äôt coexist in one landscape‚Äîand yet they do. That visual contradiction stuck with me.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Transitioning from Representation to Cognitive Compression

### 7. Muted Atmospheric Landscape *(Dec 17, 2022)*
![Muted Atmospheric Landscape](path/to/muted_atmosphere.jpg)

Here, I started compressing light and air into something more symbolic. 

It‚Äôs not a place‚Äîit‚Äôs a memory of a place. That shift felt subtle but seismic.

---

### 8. Exploding Sky over Field *(Jan 2, 2023)*
![Exploding Sky over Field](path/to/exploding_sky.jpg)

There‚Äôs motion in the color here‚Äîlike vector fields flowing through sky and field. 

It‚Äôs still grounded, but barely. Another early push into directional energy and implied forces.

---

### 9. Sunset with Silhouetted Mountain *(Jan 5, 2023)*
![Sunset with Silhouetted Mountain](path/to/silhouetted_mountain.jpg)

Static foreground, expressive sky. This one holds back more than it gives. 

I see it now as a tension piece‚Äîwanting to fracture but still behaving.

---

## üåå Immediate Predecessor to *Fractured Horizon*

### 10. Blue and Earth Mountain Cut *(Jan 12, 2023)*
![Blue and Earth Mountain Cut](path/to/blue_earth_cut.jpg)

This is where the dream starts splitting. Layered, unnatural, almost a cut-and-paste of memory rather than sight.

It's unresolved, like something familiar that got misfiled in your brain. Definitely the closest to FH without being in the series.

---

## üß© Your Trajectory Toward *Fractured Horizon*

Looking back, the arc is clear:

**Structured realism ‚Üí Emotional saturation ‚Üí Symbolic abstraction ‚Üí Spatial contradiction ‚Üí Cognitive dissonance.**

I wasn‚Äôt just painting landscapes. I was painting *how they feel when you try to remember them later.*

---

## üîç Further Evolutions: Minimalism, Liminal Space, Memory Geometry

### 11. Soft Tan Landscape *(July 15)*
![Soft Tan Landscape](path/to/soft_tan_landscape.jpg)

This barely exists. That was the point. Edges implied, forms dissolving.

A whisper of space. This is where ambiguity became my medium.

---

### 12. Blue Horizon Fade *(July 13)*
![Blue Horizon Fade](path/to/blue_horizon_fade.jpg)

Pure liminal field. It‚Äôs all tone and suggestion‚Äîan emotional gradient with no anchors.

These aren‚Äôt landscapes. They‚Äôre cognitive thresholds.

---

### 13. Abstract Swirl *(April 12)*
![Abstract Swirl](path/to/abstract_swirl.jpg)

Swirl, slash, pull. This one feels internal. Like carving memory out of space.

It‚Äôs not supposed to make sense. It‚Äôs supposed to *feel* like disorientation.

---

### 14. Purple Curves with Black Line *(April 11)*
![Purple Curves with Black Line](path/to/purple_curves.jpg)

Biological, mnemonic, spatial. This feels like something between a brain map and an MRI scan.

Lines here aren‚Äôt lines‚Äîthey‚Äôre memory folds.

---

### 15. Mirror Lake *(July 3)*
![Mirror Lake](path/to/mirror_lake.jpg)

Hyper-symmetry that lies to you. It‚Äôs balanced, but unstable.

Everything looks right, but nothing‚Äôs grounded. That‚Äôs *Fractured Horizon* energy.

---

### 16. Lavender Field + Mount Hood *(June 4)*
![Lavender Field and Mount Hood](path/to/lavender_field.jpg)

Feels more traditional‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not. The repetition in the field becomes symbolic. The mountain isn‚Äôt real; it‚Äôs a smoothed idea of one.

Another mask of familiarity hiding perceptual shift.

## üß† Final Thoughts

Every one of these pieces is a breadcrumb.

They point to the larger project: not just representing place, but unraveling how we *process* place‚Äîhow memory alters the image, how space breaks when you try to hold it still.

The *Fractured Horizon* series didn't appear out of nowhere. It grew out of this slow, messy, recursive distortion of what a landscape is supposed to be.

Let me know if you'd like this converted into a GitHub Pages theme layout, or if you want to add alt text, color analysis, or CAP metrics per piece. We can even version this with the actual FH series next.
